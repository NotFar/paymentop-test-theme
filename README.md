Developing a custom WordPress theme
=============

Theme development:

● Create a new WordPress theme from scratch.
● Implement the necessary theme files such as header.php, footer.php, index.php, and style.css.
● Connect the necessary styles and scripts to the theme.

Form fields:

● Include a section with customizable form fields (e.g., contact form).
● Make sure that the form fields are customizable and that the submitted data is saved or sent to the administrative email address.

SCSS (Sass) and JS Builder:

● Add development tools such as SCSS (Sass) and JavaScript to the theme.

----

**To customize the theme(styles and scripts) you need to install node modules in the root folder of the theme**
**Use the command:**
	`$ npm install`

In development mode, use the commands
	`$ npm run watch`

To minify styles and scripts, use the command
	`$ npm run prod`

----


**After activating the theme, you will see new menu items, Theme FAQs and Theme Forms in the admin panel.**

You can create any number of FAQs and contact forms. Each form or FAQ will be automatically assigned a shortcode that you can insert into any content place in the edit page or post.

**Once you publish a page or post, you'll see forms and FAQs directly on that same page. FAQ and forms are independent of each other, so you can use as many of them as you like on one page**

**Creating and editing forms and FAQs is intuitive. You add or delete new blocks, form fields, select field types, field requirement, field sorting ....**
